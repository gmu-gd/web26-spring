<h4 id="part-1-find-examples-with-your-group">Part 1: Find examples with your group</h4>

<p>Find examples of 5 of the 10 Usability Heuristics using the <a href="https://mmcdermott18.github.io/avt415-fa25/e10/index.html">Exercise 10 Generator</a>. The generator will randomly assign 5 of the 10 heuristics and you and your group will find web based examples for each one you were assigned. For each heuristic, find an example from a website and take a screenshot of it. The screenshots can be cropped in but they need to include any supporting elements to help visually show the heuristic.</p>

<h4 id="part-2-individually-design-your-presentation">Part 2: Individually design your presentation</h4>

<p>Once you have an example for each of your heuristics, create five frames in Figma that are 1440px by 768px with each containing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A screenshot showing the example of one of your heuristics.</li>
  <li>Include a link to the website where the screenshot is from.</li>
  <li>The title and definition of the heuristic from the slides (find a link to the slides on Canvas).</li>
  <li>A brief explanation explaining why you are using this screenshot as an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>To finish, link the frames together and submit the link to your prototype on Canvas and add it to your website.</p>
