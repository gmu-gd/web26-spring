#### Exercise 3: Hover and Animations
Add hover effects to your links from Exercise 2. Each link on each artboard should have a hover effect for it. If you want to work in some kind of animation you can do that too. This is another opportunity to update the design if you need to either to improve it or to adjust the navigation elements.

##### Technical Requirements
* Add a hover effect for each link/navigation element in your design
* Link to a new working prototype on your class website
