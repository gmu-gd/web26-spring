#### Exercise 5: Make it Responsive
Translate your partner's GRAMMY Awards landing page from the desktop design to a mobile design. The new page should be designed at 320px wide and follow the design as closely as possible, adapting it to the new size, not redesigning it. All content from the desktop size should be available but the way it is accessed or shown could change.

##### Technical Requirements
* All content from desktop designs available
* Prototype has the desktop design and your new mobile design
* Page is as tall as it needs to be
